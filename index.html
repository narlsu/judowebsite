					<p>
						Judo, which when translates into English as the ‘gentle way’, is an Olympic sport best known for its spectacular throwing techniques. It also involves considerable ground fighting, using specialized pins, control holds, arm locks, and choking techniques. The twin emphases in Judo are safety and full physical activity for top conditioning. By training regularly, you will improve your general fitness, flexibility, strength, coordination, reaction time, and above all, your self-confidence.</p>
					<p>
						Judo was developed in 1882 and quickly proved its effectiveness against other martial arts systems. Its spread throughout the world started in Great Britain, France and Russia where it took on distinctly regional ‘flavours’. Judo continues to be an influence on martial arts throughout the world.</p> 
					<p>	
						The white pyjama suit and coloured belt system were both innovations developed by 	judo’s pioneers which have been adopted by countless other martial arts. Judo techniques and principles have been borrowed by or have formed the basis of other martial arts systems.</p>
